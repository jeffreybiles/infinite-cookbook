* Fluidity
  * Switch to something faster for generating content (groq?)
  * Streaming content for the recipes
  * Animations for going between existing recipes
  * Animations for when waiting + when selecting changes
* Proompting
  * Separate call to get title for recipe (bonus: "make it unique from this list (parent chain)").  Save it.  Show it when displaying the recipe.
  * Prompt for updating should act as if it's generating for the first time
  * Generate suggested modifications (try using LLM for it), add buttons for those
  * Make it refuse non-recipe requests (add smaller LLM to check whether the responses are a recipe, fail them if not)
* Start storing preferences based on the modifications
* Bonus: make a 'chain' that's visible all at once.  And I guess branching?  This could be challenging on the database as currently constructed
