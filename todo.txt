* Proompting
  * Separate call to get title for recipe (bonus: "make it unique from this list (parent chain)").  Save it.  Show it when displaying the recipe.
  * Try JSON Mode, getting array of ingredients/amounts + directions.  This can then be used for styling better than we could with markdown.
* Preferences
  * Have preference options for allergens, spices, ingredients, etc.
  * Start storing preferences based on the modifications.  The allergens and spice level should be saved, as well as things they remove.  What about things they add?
* Fluidity
  * Streaming content for the recipes
  * Animations for going between existing recipes
  * Animations for when waiting + when selecting changes
* Script to generate 20 more categories of food + icons and download the images
* Bonus: make a 'chain' that's visible all at once.  And I guess branching?  This could be challenging on the database as currently constructed
