* Basics
  * Separate sections on home page so it shows the URL options easier
  * Better display of recipe and suggestions in recipe show page (idk how)
* Add original_id, group everything in the chain
  * migration to add it + make connections with existing stuff
  * make Previous Recipes page use the linking, group them up - maybe show the chain
  * make the chain show up better at the top of the recipe show page
* Preferences
  * Have preference options for allergens, spices, ingredients, etc.
  * Start storing preferences based on the modifications.  The allergens and spice level should be saved, as well as things they remove.  What about things they add?
* Proompting
  * Try JSON Mode, getting array of ingredients/amounts + directions.  This can then be used for styling better than we could with markdown.
* Fluidity
  * Streaming content for the recipes
  * Animations for going between existing recipes
  * Animations for when waiting + when selecting changes
* Deploy
