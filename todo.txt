* Allow retry when JSON doesn't generate correctly.  Example: (Error: Error code: 400 - {'error': {'message': "Failed to generate JSON. Please adjust your prompt. See 'failed_generation' for more details.", 'type': 'invalid_request_error', 'code': 'json_validate_failed', 'failed_generation': '{\n   "Vegetable Curry"\n}'}})
* Preferences
  * Have preference options for allergens, spices, ingredients, etc.
  * Start storing preferences based on the modifications.  The allergens and spice level should be saved, as well as things they remove.  What about things they add?
* Get the initial recipe from a page
* Proompting
  * Try JSON Mode, getting array of ingredients/amounts + directions.  This can then be used for styling better than we could with markdown.
* Fluidity
  * Streaming content for the recipes
  * Animations for going between existing recipes
  * Animations for when waiting + when selecting changes
* Bonus: make a 'chain' that's visible all at once.  And I guess branching?  This could be challenging on the database as currently constructed
