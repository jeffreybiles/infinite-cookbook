* Switch to UV
* Deploy
  * Create Dockerfiles
  * Do terraform setup
* Fluidity
  * Animations for going between existing recipes
  * Animations for when waiting + when selecting changes
* Auth
* Save preferences on the backend, with the user (and then can remove them from the post requests!)
* Preferences v2
  * Start storing preferences based on the modifications?
  * Have a liking/disliking aspect, which then gets worked into a RAG system?
* Design improvements
  * Better display of recipe and suggestions in recipe show page (idk how)
  * When showing chain, make branching clearer
  * Consider JSON Mode for the recipes, getting array of ingredients/amounts + directions.  This can then be used for styling better than we could with markdown.
