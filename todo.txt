* Initial page
  * Allow custom dish requests
  * Generate 20 categories of food, allow generations of more
* Preferences
  * Have preference options for allergens, spices, ingredients, etc.
  * Start storing preferences based on the modifications.  The allergens and spice level should be saved, as well as things they remove.  What about things they add?
* Proompting
  * Try JSON Mode, getting array of ingredients/amounts + directions.  This can then be used for styling better than we could with markdown.
* Fluidity
  * Streaming content for the recipes
  * Animations for going between existing recipes
  * Animations for when waiting + when selecting changes

* Bonus: make a 'chain' that's visible all at once.  And I guess branching?  This could be challenging on the database as currently constructed
