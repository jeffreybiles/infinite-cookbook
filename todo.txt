* Preferences v1
  * Preference page with common restrictions (peanut, gluten, vegan, kosher, halal, etc.), spice level preference, a list of foods you want to avoid, and a list of foods you enjoy.  JSON in localhost for now
  * Integrate preferences into recipe creation and suggestion creation.  Have to send up with every request for now.
* Basics
  * Better display of recipe and suggestions in recipe show page (idk how)
* Proompting
  * Try JSON Mode, getting array of ingredients/amounts + directions.  This can then be used for styling better than we could with markdown.
* Fluidity
  * Streaming content for the recipes
  * Animations for going between existing recipes
  * Animations for when waiting + when selecting changes
* Deploy
* Auth
* Preferences v2
  * Start storing preferences based on the modifications?
  * Have a liking/disliking aspect, which then gets worked into a RAG system?
* When showing chain, make branching clearer
